    "2] What is exception handling in Python?  \n",
    "Ans] Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to gracefully handle runtime errors so that the program doesn’t crash unexpectedly. Instead of stopping abruptly, Python allows you to catch errors, respond to them, and continue execution.  \n",
    "An exception is an error that occurs during program execution.  \n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "ZeroDivisionError → dividing by zero  \n",
    "ValueError → invalid type conversion, e.g., int(\"abc\")  \n",
    "FileNotFoundError → trying to open a non-existent file  "

    "15]  How does Python's garbage collection system work?  \n",
    "Ans] Python’s garbage collection (GC) system is responsible for automatically managing memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. This ensures efficient memory usage and prevents memory leaks.  \n",
    "Reference Counting  \n",
    "Core mechanism: Each object in Python keeps a reference count, which is the number of references pointing to it.  \n",
    "When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it means no part of the program is using it, so Python automatically deallocates its memory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Circular References  \n",
    "Reference counting alone cannot handle circular references (e.g., objects referencing each other).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gc Module  \n",
    "Python provides the gc module to interact with the garbage collector.  \n",
