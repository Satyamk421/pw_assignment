    "1] What are data structures, and why are they important?  \n",
    "Ans] Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data efficiently, enabling programs to perform operations like searching, sorting, and accessing information effectively.  \n",

    "- A list is mutable, which means its elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created.  \n",
    "- Iterating through a list is generally slower compared to a tuple because of its dynamic and flexible nature.  \n",
    "- Lists are well-suited for operations such as insertion, deletion, and appending elements during runtime.  \n",
    "- Lists consume more memory than tuples because they allow for dynamic resizing and storage flexibility.  \n",
    "- Lists offer a wide range of built-in methods like append(), remove(), sort(), and extend() to perform various operations.  \n",

    "6] What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?  \n",
    "Ans] In Python, a string is an immutable sequence of characters, used to represent text. Strings are defined by enclosing characters within single quotes ('...'), double quotes (\"...\"), or triple quotes ('''...''' or \"\"\"...\"\"\") for multiline strings.  \n",
    "Difference between String and List are as follows:-  \n",
    "Mutability:  \n",
    "- A string is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created.  \n",
    "- A list is mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements in it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Element Type:  \n",
    "- A string contains only characters, and each character is accessed by index.  \n",
    "- A list can contain mixed data types, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:  \n",
    "- Strings are written in quotes, like \"hello\" or 'world'.  \n",
    "- Lists are written in square brackets, like ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'].  \n",
    "\n",
    "Modification:  \n",
    "- You cannot modify a string directly; to make changes, you must create a new string.  \n",
    "- You can modify a list directly by using indexing, slicing, or list methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality and Methods:  \n",
    "- Strings have text-related methods such as .upper(), .lower(), .replace(), .split(), etc.  \n",

    "8] What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?  \n",
    "Ans] A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing for efficient retrieval of values based on their associated keys. It utilizes a hash function to map keys to specific indices within an underlying array. When a key-value pair is inserted, the hash function computes an index from the key, and the value is stored at that location. For retrieval, the same hash function is applied to the key to quickly locate the corresponding value.  \n",
    "In Python, a dictionary (dict) is implemented using a hash table internally.  \n",
    "For example:-  \n",
    "Applies a hash function to the key (e.g., \"name\").  \n",
    "Finds an index in an internal array.  \n",

    "10]  Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
    "Ans] Strings in Python are \"immutable\" which means they can not be changed after they are created.   \n",
    "The immutability of Python string is very useful as it helps in hashing, performance optimization, safety, ease of use, etc.  \n",
    "- Efficiency and Performance  \n",
    "Strings are used a lot (in keys, messages, etc.).  \n",
    "If they were mutable, frequent changes could make string operations slow and memory-intensive.  \n",
    "Immutability allows Python to reuse string objects (called string interning) which saves memory and speeds up performance  \n",
    "- Hashing and Dictionary Keys  \n",
    "Strings can be used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in sets.  \n",
    "To do this, they must be hashable.  \n",
    "Mutable objects can change their value, which would break dictionary key lookup.  \n",
    "So, immutable strings ensure reliable and consistent hash values.  \n",
    "- Thread-Safety  \n",
    "Since strings can't be changed, they're safe to use in multi-threaded programs without worrying about unexpected modifications.  \n",
    "- Predictable Behavior  \n",
    "When you pass a string to a function or use it in expressions, you can be sure its value won't change unexpectedly.  \n",

    "11] What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?  \n",
    "Ans] \n",
    "- Dictionaries in Python offer fast data retrieval: Unlike lists where you have to traverse through each element to find a value, dictionaries use hash tables for quick access to values based on keys.  \n",
    "- Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, making the relationship between pieces of data much clearer. For example, storing a person's name and age in a dictionary is more readable and meaningful than placing them in a list.  \n",
    "- With a dictionary, you don’t need to remember the position of a value as you do with a list. Instead, you can use descriptive keys like \"name\" or \"age\", which makes the code easier to understand and maintain.  \n",
    "- Dictionaries are more flexible when it comes to modifying data. You can easily add, update, or remove entries using keys, without worrying about the order or position of items like you would in a list.  \n",
    "- When working with structured or labeled data, dictionaries are often more appropriate. They are ideal for representing things like user profiles, database records, and settings, where each piece of data has a unique label.  \n",
    "- Dictionaries are used in many real-world scenarios, such as JSON objects and configuration files, because they allow data to be organized with meaningful identifiers instead of relying on positions."

    "Ans] In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, which provide very fast access to elements.  \n",
    "- Average Case: O(1)  \n",
    "Accessing an element using a key is constant time, meaning it takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the dictionary.\n",

    "- Ordered Data without Keys  \n",

    "19] Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?  \n",
    "Ans] Dictionaries were called unordered because they store and find items by key, not by position. This means the order didn’t matter before.\n",
    "Now in newer Python versions, they do keep order, but the way you get data is still by key, not by position.  \n",
    "When you added items to a dictionary, their order during iteration could be random or unexpected.\n",
    "This is because hash tables store data based on the hash of the keys, not based on when you added them.  \n",
    "-Access by Key is Fast  \n",
    "You can quickly find a value using its key.  \n",
    "It doesn’t matter where the item is in the dictionary.  \n",
    "This is because dictionaries use hashing, which gives O(1) (constant time) access while list takes O(n) Time Complexity.  \n",

    "20] Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval?  \n",
    "Ans] A list stores items in a specific order, and you access them using their position, called an index. For example, the first item is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.  \n",
    "A dictionary, on the other hand, stores key-value pairs, and you access items using their key, not their position. For example, if you have a person's name stored under the key \"name\", you get it using my_dict[\"name\"].  \n",
    "Data retrieval in a list can be slower if you have to search for a specific value, especially in large lists. But in a dictionary, finding a value by its key is very fast, no matter how big the dictionary is.  \n",
    "In summary, use a list when you need to keep things in order and access them by number, and use a dictionary when you want to label your data and look it up quickly using those labels.  "
