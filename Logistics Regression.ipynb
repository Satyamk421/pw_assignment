    "Q1] What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear Regression?  \n",
    "Ans] Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems.  \n",
    "It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class (category).  \n",
    "Let‚Äôs say you want to predict whether a student will pass (1) or fail (0) based on study hours.  \n",
    "Input: X = study hours  \n",
    "Output: Y = 1 (pass) or 0 (fail)  \n",
    "Instead of predicting a continuous number (like Linear Regression does), Logistic Regression predicts:  \n",
    "The probability that Y = 1 (student passes).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid function to ‚Äúsquash‚Äù the output of a linear equation.    \n",
    "1 Linear Regression is used to predict a continuous numeric value, while Logistic Regression is used to predict a categorical outcome such as Yes/No or 0/1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2 In Linear Regression, the output can take any real value (from negative infinity to positive infinity), whereas in Logistic Regression, the output is always between 0 and 1, representing a probability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3 Linear Regression fits a straight line to the data, showing a linear relationship between the input and output, while Logistic Regression fits an S-shaped (sigmoid) curve to map values into probabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4 Linear Regression directly predicts a numeric value, but Logistic Regression predicts a probability, which is then converted into a class label using a threshold (commonly 0.5).  \n",
    "\n",
    "5 Linear Regression produces a straight-line decision boundary, whereas Logistic Regression produces a sigmoid-shaped probability boundary that helps separate classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6 Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, whereas Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7 The error function (or loss function) used in Linear Regression is Mean Squared Error (MSE), while Logistic Regression uses Log Loss (Binary Cross-Entropy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "8 Linear Regression is applied to problems like predicting house prices, sales, or temperature, while Logistic Regression is used for predicting spam detection, disease diagnosis, or customer churn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "10 Finally, Linear Regression is meant for regression tasks (continuous outputs), and Logistic Regression is meant for classification tasks (discrete outputs).   \n"

    "2] Explain the role of the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression?  \n",
    "Ans] The Sigmoid function is a mathematical function that converts any real number (from ‚àí‚àû to +‚àû) into a value between 0 and 1.  \n",
    "In Logistic Regression, we want to predict the probability that a data point belongs to a certain class (e.g., 1 = yes, 0 = no).\n",
    "But the linear equation   \n",
    "b0‚Äã+b1‚Äãx can produce any value ‚Äî positive, negative, or zero.  \n",
    "That‚Äôs not suitable for a probability (which must be between 0 and 1).  \n",

    "So, the Sigmoid function ‚Äúsquashes‚Äù this linear output into the range [0, 1].  \n",

    "3] What is Regularization in Logistic Regression and why is it needed?  \n",
    "Ans] Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in a model by adding a penalty term to the model‚Äôs loss (cost) function.  \n",
    "When training Logistic Regression (or any model), the algorithm tries to minimize a loss function ‚Äî in this case, the log loss (or cross-entropy loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don‚Äôt control the model, it might:  \n",
    "Fit too closely to the training data (overfitting)  \n",
    "Learn noise or irrelevant patterns  \n",
    "Perform poorly on new (test) data  \n",
    "To fix this, regularization adds an extra term that penalizes large weights (coefficients) ‚Äî forcing the model to stay simpler and more generalizable.  \n",

    "4] What are some common evaluation metrics for classification models, and why are they important?  \n",
